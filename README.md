### Hi there :leopard:

I hold a Bachelor's degree in **Cognitive Science** from the University of Osnabrück and a Master's degree in **Data Science** from the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland.

Every day, I wake up excited to learn something new. I will combine my passion for computer science and the human body to maximize the positive impact I can have on our world.

If I can recommend one book to you, it would be [A Thousand Brains](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/54503521) by Jeff Hawkins.
